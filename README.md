# CNN for Text Classification in Tensorflow

This is a simpliefied implementation of Kim's [Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882) paper in Tensorflow. 

Notable differences are:

- No pretrained word vectors or dual channels


## Requirements

- Python 2.7
- Tensorflow

## Setup
